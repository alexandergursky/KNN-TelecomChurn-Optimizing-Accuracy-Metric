# KNN_TelecomChurn_Simple

In this project I start out by doing a simple example of KNN in Jupyter Notebook, followed by showing how to quickly
aquire accuracy while going over the general concept of what was happening. Third I iterated over potential Kappa values in order to find the one that would
yield the highest level of accuracy for the model and dataset, also created a visualization to show. Lastly I programmed the model at its most optimal Kappa value and displayed the 
metrics associated, going over what was happening, and providing my personal input for potental solutions going forward. - Alexander Gursky
